**Custom Memory Management System**

This project implements a custom memory management system in C, providing functionalities similar to malloc, free, and realloc. The system is designed to manage heap memory efficiently, including handling block splitting, coalescing, and maintaining free lists.

Features
Memory Allocation (sf_malloc): Allocates a block of memory of the specified size.
Memory Deallocation (sf_free): Frees a previously allocated block of memory.
Memory Reallocation (sf_realloc): Changes the size of a previously allocated block of memory.
Fragmentation Calculation (sf_fragmentation): Calculates the fragmentation of the heap.
Utilization Calculation (sf_utilization): Calculates the utilization of the heap.
